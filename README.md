## Candidate Notes BY SHEHAB FEKRY

Hey there, i just wanted to mention that i have done my best implementing this feature  
even though i have dropped some concepts implmentations on porpose, because i was under alot of pressure trying to implement it
along side my work tasks, i hope that what i have done is satisfying.

Also, as i have mentioned in the code i have tried the API for fetching hotels with diffrent payloads
but was giving me 200 success response without giving any useful data, so i coudn't figure out how to create the hotel component
which should be used in the list.

## STEPS I HAVE FOLLOWED

1. **configuration of TAILWIND CSS and GLOBAL CSS file**

   - global.css
   - tailwind.config.
